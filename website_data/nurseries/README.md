## Why Potty Train at Your Nursery?

### Build confidence and prevent health issues

Getting potty trained is a big step for children towards independence. They no longer rely on their caretakers to change them and wipe their bums. They can do it themselves! A big boost for their confidence and self esteem. And once children have tackled the potty training hurdle, they have more space to develop other cognitive and motoric skills.

Besides that, if children start potty training late (after 3 years) they have a higher chance at health issues such as constipation and bed wetting.

### Reduce workload and save on nappy costs

Changing nappies is much more work than helping children to go potty. Once our program is fully implemented you actually save time and reduce the work pressure for your nursery staff. Your staff will thank you for it later 😉

Besides that, earlier potty training can be a great saving. You can reduce your nappy and waste disposal costs by 30% to 50%.

### Happy and healthy planet for our children

Disposable nappies have a detrimental impact on the environment. For your nursery roughly 50% of your waste comes from disposable nappies.

Stimulating parents to start potty training on time can lead to a 30% to 50% reduction in your nappy waste and related CO2 emissions.

Less waste and less CO2 = a happier and healthier planet. Together, we make a difference – for children, parents and the world of tomorrow.

## How does Go Potty® work for nurseries?

Parents potty train their child (from 18 months) at home with support from the Go Potty® app.

### Step 2: Nursery staff support children with potty training

Nursery staff support the children with potty training in baby and toddler groups. They get the right skills and knowledge via Go Potty® e-learnings.

### Step 3: Dashboard for nurseries

Through an interactive dashboard, nurseries can easily monitor the progress of the Go Potty® program in real time.

## More potty-trained children = more equal opportunities

Not every family knows when or how to start potty training. With Go Potty®, you help close the gap — preventing developmental delays and reducing pressure on nurseries, schools and waste systems.

## What Municipalities Get

- Insight through data: progress, participation and savings
- Less waste and lower CO₂ from reduced nappy use
- Stronger local collaboration with nurseries and public health services
- An equal start for every child, regardless of home situation
- A proven approach that truly supports families and childcare providers

**"Being potty trained early means more confidence, less waste and better school readiness. This is prevention at its best."**

## The Challenge

**Saving the world one nappy at a time**

Children are being potty trained ever later. In the 1940s, most children were potty trained at around 12 months. Now, they are 3 years old on average. This negatively affects the environment and children's health. At the same time many parents struggle with potty training. They are unsure whether their child is ready or how to best train their child. Often this leads to delayed potty training.

We say goodbye to the habit of late potty training. For most children, 18 months is a great age for potty training. Together with nurseries and child health centres we support parents to start potty training on time and make the process fun and smooth. Let's go potty together!

**With the Go Potty® approach, children are potty trained 6 to 12 months earlier than average.**

## Why Potty Train at Municipal Level?

### Decrease waste disposal costs

Disposable nappies contribute significantly to municipal waste streams. This is usually around 7% of all household waste, leading to high collection and processing costs.

By promoting earlier potty training, municipalities can reduce the volume of waste, directly lowering expenses associated with landfill use, incineration and/or recycling infrastructure.

### Reduce nappy waste & CO2

Disposable nappies create 300 pounds of waste per child per year. For a city with 10,000 inhabitants this amounts to 30 tons of nappy waste on an annual basis.

Sometimes disposable nappies are recycled, but in the Netherlands this is rarely the case. Only 3% of all nappy waste is recycled in the Netherlands due to limited recycling capacity.

### Ensure equal opportunities & health

Nowadays 2 children in each preschool class are not potty trained. In some cases, this means children are not allowed to go to school. Which affects their ability to develop their cognitive and motoric skills.

Besides that, if children start potty training late (after 3 years) they have a higher chance at health issues such as constipation, bed wetting and bladder infections.

## How does Go Potty® work for municipalities?

### Step 1: Parents potty train their child

Parents potty train their child at home with support from the Go Potty® app.

### Step 2: Nurseries and child health centres stimulate parents

Nursery and child health centre staff get the right knowledge through a succinct e-learning and stimulate parents to start potty training with the Go Potty® app.

### Step 3: Dashboard for municipalities

Through an interactive dashboard, the municipality and partners can monitor the progress of the Go Potty® program in real time (number of participating children, kilos of nappy waste saved etc.)

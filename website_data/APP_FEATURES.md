## 🎯 Core App Features

### 1. Readiness Assessment Tests
The app includes two diagnostic tests to determine if your child and family are ready for potty training:

- **Child Readiness Test**: Assesses your child's physical and mental development signs
  - Doesn't focus on age, but on developmental readiness
  - Identifies key indicators like staying dry for periods, showing interest, communicating needs

- **Parent Readiness Test**: Evaluates your family's preparedness
  - Considers your lifestyle, schedule, and readiness level
  - Helps ensure the family is on the same page

**Key Insight**: You don't need to wait for your child to show interest in the potty themselves. Multiple developmental signs indicate readiness independent of age.

### 2. Method Selection Tool
The app helps you choose between two scientifically-backed potty training approaches:

#### **Intensive Method** (3-5 Days)
- Switch from nappies to pants in one go (day and potentially night)
- Teach basics in 3-5 days
- Requires staying at home with commitment
- Many accidents and cleanup needed
- Success requires: staying calm, positivity, consistency, perseverance
- Best for: Families with time to commit

#### **Gradual Method** (10 Weeks)
- Introduce potty in small steps
- Child gradually gets comfortable over time
- More spaced-out learning curve
- Parental involvement increases gradually
- Allows parent adjustment time
- Best for: Families preferring gentle approach

**Important**: Both methods are scientifically validated. The app helps you choose what works for YOUR child and YOUR family.

### 3. Personalized E-Guide
Your personal potty training guide is customized based on:
- Your child's **age**
- Your child's **personality** and temperament
- Your **family preferences** and situation
- The **method chosen** (intensive or gradual)

The guide is continuously updated as you progress through potty training and mark milestones.

## Overview

Potty training for parents, nurseries & municipalities

**Children can become potty trained earlier. Earlier than you think!**

At Go Potty®, we help children ditch the nappies on time, for their independence, future, and a cleaner world. Because every child deserves a strong start.

## Why Potty Train Early?

Potty training isn't just good for your child's development – it has a much broader impact.

### Confidence and Independence

Potty training means growing up. With Go Potty®, your child takes a big step towards independence. They learn to recognise and communicate their needs, build confidence, and gain space to grow – physically, socially, and emotionally.

Together, we make sure every child, regardless of background, gets the right start and equal opportunities at school and beyond.

### Nappies Are Expensive – Potty Training Pays Off

Disposable nappies cost families around £40–£50 a month – that's up to £550 a year per child. By starting potty training earlier, families can save significantly.

For nurseries, the costs add up even faster. With Go Potty®, early training can reduce nappy expenses by up to 50% – while children grow more independent and waste goes down.

### Environmental Impact

Each child in disposable nappies creates around 300kg of waste per year – that's over 7% of all household waste. Difficult to recycle, and mostly unnecessary.

By potty training earlier, you save money and reduce waste. Better for your child, better for the planet. Together, we're building a more conscious and circular future.

# Go Potty® - Frequently Asked Questions

## Readiness & Age Questions

### Q: What age can you start potty training?

**A:** This depends on your child. Every child develops in their own way and at their own pace. If your child meets a number of criteria, you are ready to start.

**Key Point**: Don't focus on your child's age, but on their **physical and mental development**.

**Benchmark Age**: 18 months is a great age for potty training from a physical point of view. In many countries, children are potty trained before 12 months.

**How to Check**: Do the test in the app to check whether your child is ready.

### Q: Do I need to wait until my child shows an interest in the potty or toilet themselves?

**A:** **No, you don't need to wait** until your child shows an interest themselves. This is a common myth perpetuated by the nappy industry.

Every child develops in their own way and at their own pace. If your child meets a number of criteria, you are ready to start.

**Key Point**: Don't focus on your child's age, but on their **physical and mental development**.

**What This Means**:
- Interest is NOT a prerequisite for readiness
- Many developmental signs indicate readiness independent of interest
- Some children show interest without being ready
- Some children are ready without showing obvious interest

**How to Check**: Do the test in the Go Potty® app to check whether your child is ready.

### Q: Can you start potty training too late?

**A:** Yes, starting too late can have health consequences.

**Important Finding**: Several scientific studies show that there CAN be consequences for your child's health when starting potty training too late.

**When It's Too Late**: When starting at a later age (after 3 years), there is a slightly higher chance that your child will develop:
- Incontinence (bed wetting)
- Constipation
- Refusal to poop on a potty or toilet
- Bladder infections

**Health Implications**:
- Late potty training is linked to ongoing health issues
- Early potty training is preventative
- 18 months is ideal for avoiding these problems
- Most children trained by 2-2.5 years avoid most health issues

**What To Do**: Want to know if your child is ready? Download the Go Potty® app for free and do the self-test.

## Methods & Approaches

### Q: What do the Go Potty® methods entail?

**A:** We provide you with **two methods to choose from**. Both are scientifically validated and backed by research.

#### Method 1: Intensive Method

**Duration**: 3 to 5 days

**What It Involves**:
- Switch from nappy to pants in one go (during the day and potentially also at night)
- Teach your child the basics in 3 to 5 days
- Staying at home with commitment during this period
- Lots of accidents and lots of cleanup
- Requires patience and positive attitude

**Success Requirements**:
- Stay calm during accidents
- Maintain positive attitude throughout
- Be consistent in your approach
- Persevere even when it's challenging

**Best For**:
- Families with time to commit
- Parents who prefer quick results
- Children who respond well to intensive learning

---

#### Method 2: Gradual Method

**Duration**: About 10 weeks

**What It Involves**:
- Allow time for your child to get used to the potty
- Adjust to this big change slowly
- Introduce the potty in small steps
- Progress as your child gets more comfortable
- Gradual increase in accepting and successful use

**Benefits**:
- Your involvement increases gradually
- Gives you time to adjust too
- Less disruptive to family routine
- Gentler approach for cautious children

**Best For**:
- Families preferring gradual change
- More sensitive or cautious children
- Parents wanting to maintain routines
- Situations with less time flexibility

---

### Q: Potty trained in 3 to 5 days. Is that really possible?

**A:** **Yes, absolutely!** Most definitely possible!

**Proof**: Hundreds of parents have successfully done it already.

**With The Right Guidance**: Most children get through it in 3 to 5 days.

**Important Caveat**:
- We deliberately say "3 to 5 days" - not "guaranteed 3 days"
- Every child and every situation is different
- Some take longer than others
- Some children need more than 5 days
- **Everyone learns at their own pace**

**Not For Everyone?**: If the intensive method isn't right for you, we also offer a more gradual approach - a 10-week program where you introduce the potty in small steps.

**How to Choose**: In the app, we help you choose the right approach for you and your child.

---

### Q: Which method should I choose?

The app helps you determine which method is best through the **method preference test**, which considers:
- Your lifestyle and time availability
- Your child's personality and temperament
- Your parenting style
- Your family situation
- Your comfort level with potential challenges

Both methods are proven effective - the key is choosing what works for YOUR family.

## Reward Systems & Motivation

### Q: Does Go Potty® use a reward system?

**A:** **No, we do not offer a reward system.**

**Why Not?**: Here's what the research shows:
- Every child is different
- Whether rewards help depends on YOUR child
- In most cases, **mom and dad's pride is enough** to motivate a child
- Reward systems can be difficult to phase out
- They can create dependency: "child only performs behavior when reward is offered"

**What This Means**:
- Kids become motivated by pleasing their parents
- Natural pride in accomplishment is powerful
- Intrinsic motivation is more sustainable
- Avoids long-term behavioral dependency

**Your Options**:
- Use our method without rewards (recommended)
- Use our method AND create your own reward system if you think it will really work for your child
- Find what motivates YOUR child specifically

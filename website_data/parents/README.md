## Getting Started with Potty Training?

### When to start potty training?

You wonder how you know when your child is ready for potty training. Should you wait until your child starts showing interest in the potty or toilet by themselves? And what is the best age to start potty training?

### Potty training advice overload

Google, social media and advice from friends and your mother-in-law about potty training. What is true now? You can't see the forest for the trees. You just want to know what works for YOUR child.

### What potty training approach will work best?

Should you go for potty training in three days? Or will a more gradual potty training approach work better for your child? You want to make sure you're not pushing your child and not forcing anything.

### You have a very busy life

You have a busy life. Work, family, sports and socialising. You have no time to do research about potty training. In fact, you have very little time and energy to work on potty training at all.

**Recognise this? The Go Potty® app gives you the right tools and support to get it right the first time. Your child will be potty trained in no time!**

## Why Potty Train?

### Build your child's confidence and self esteem

Getting potty trained is a big step for your child towards independence. They no longer rely on their caretakers to change them and wipe their bums. They can do it themselves! It's a big boost for their confidence and self esteem. And once your child has tackled the potty training hurdle, they have more space to develop other cognitive and motoric skills.

### You save £500

Nappies cost a lot of money. On average, disposable nappies cost £42 per month. That's around £500 per year! That would be a great saving, wouldn't it?

### Happy and healthy planet for our children

Disposable nappies are hardly recyclable and create 300 pounds of waste per child per year. Each wash of washable nappies consumes about 60 liters of water.

## What Is Go Potty?

Go Potty® is a scientifically-backed potty training app and service platform that helps:
- **Parents** train their children earlier with personalized guidance
- **Nurseries** support children with coordinated training and save on nappy costs
- **Municipalities** implement community-wide programs and reduce waste

## Key Insights

### The Problem They Solve
Children are being potty trained much later than in previous generations (3 years vs 1 year in the 1940s), due to disposable nappy convenience.

### The Solution
A holistic, evidence-based approach that trains children around 18 months, resulting in:
- ✅ 6-12 months earlier potty training
- 💰 £500+/year savings per family
- 🌍 300kg waste reduction per child/year
- 🏥 Prevention of health issues
- ♼ Lower CO2 emissions

### Core Philosophy
"Saving the world one nappy at a time"
